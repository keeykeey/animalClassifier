environment : tf140 (anaconda)

when running the download.py, put the "forego run python3 downloaded.py <ANIMALNAME>".
The reason why put "forego run" is that I wanted not to write api token directly in the script "download.py" so that I had to use forego which is the tool to pass the environmental variance.
